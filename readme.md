The reason, I chose to make this kind of game is because, I enjoy such multiple questions games myself and this felt like great opportunity to do it for this project.

I did a lot of research to built this game, and I believe I was able to achieve 75 percent of my goal. 

This game is built with HTML, CSS and Javascript, jQuery and Flexbox. In addition, with little bit of background animation.

Since its my first project, it was bit difficult to work on it and unfortunately I was not able to build some functions I wanted to. For instance, make it a two player game.

One thing I realized is that working on such projects is a good learning experience. You spent most of the gathering information on how to build certain functions, and by applying those functions in to your code, you open a lot of new technologies to yourself.
