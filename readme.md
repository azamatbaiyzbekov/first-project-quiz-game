# Your General Quiz Game

My first ever solo project as part of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive. This game was initially on github enterpises, and I decided to move it in to my personal github account.

- Each correct answer is equal to 1 point. Also, keep in mind that there is a timer set to 60 seconds. 
- In terms of difficulty, the questions are medium level questions . 

## Technology 

- Javascript
- jQuery
- HTML
- CSS Animation

----------------------------------------------------------

## Motivation 

The reason, I chose to make this kind of game is because, I enjoy such multiple questions games myself and this felt like great opportunity to do it for this particular project.

I did a lot of research to built this game, and I believe I was able to achieve 75 percent of my goal. Since it was my first project, it was bit difficult to work on it, and unfortunately I was not able to build some functions I wanted to. For instance, make it a two player game. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
## What I learnt 

One thing I realized is that working on such projects is a good learning experience. You spent most of the gathering information on how to build certain functions, and by applying those functions in to your code, you open a lot of new technologies to yourself.
